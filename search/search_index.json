It doesnt synergise as well with Soul Split  however is still a decent dps option. \u2b25 Zerk auras   are generally to be avoided unless stated otherwise due to increased damage taken. \u2b25 Penance  If a method can survive with penance, it will reduce supply usage by 2 Penance powder , with slightly lower kph. This can often result in higher profit. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Use at your own discretion. \u2b25 Equilibrium  boosts ability damage by 12% but prevents you dealing critical strikes. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Used in situations where consistency is key over RNG-based crits. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Also used due to its long duration (2 hours) and inexpensive cost to extend/reset as a Tier 2 aura.  <p>\u200b</p>"},{"location":"pvme-guides/afk/afk-overview/#relic-choices","title":"Relic Choices","text":"<p>\u2b25 It will be assumed that all AFK set-tups use Persistent Rage  unless stated otherwise.

Expect to eat a lot of food during this fight. Masuta is a fairly hard fight, dealing both high burst and sustained damage on the player. He is considered by some to be the hardest in the dungeon.</p> <p>\u200b</p> Mechanics P1 Rotation \u2b25 Masuta attacks at the fight using the following rotation: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 2-4 autos \u2192 Hurricane \u2192 3-5 autos \u2192 Tsunami \u2192 3-5 autos \u2192 Repeats from Hurricane. \u200b Autoattack information \u2b25 Masuta mostly uses  during p1, occasionally using  Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Occasionally, he summons a clone while using  which deals an additional hit. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 It is important to block these doubled autos with  \u200b Hurricane \u2b25 Masuta starts spinning for about 12 seconds, hitting nearby players for increasing Melee damage once per tick, chasing after you at walking speed during this attack. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 The best way to deal with this is  +  1 GCD after the attack starts, allowing you to deal damage in MD and nullifies most of the damage you take. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 If using ranged, you may kite Masuta and use  once he finishes spinning. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 It's possible to  Masuta from the north side during this attack. \u200b Tsunami \u2b25 After Hurricane, Masuta returns to autoing, usually around the 4th, 5th or 6th autoattack, purple waters appear around the arena. The purples water thrash about while Masuta uses 3 more autos. Right after the 3rd auto, Masuta uses a Tsunami on his target. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 These hit you with two extremely high (7k+)  hits. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 This can be dealt with by using both  and  after Masuta's 3rd autoattack. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 You can also move far enough to avoid getting hit. This can be done by either running or using  as the auto before the  hits. Example \u200b Pulverise \u2b25 After Tsunami, for the rest of Phase 1 Masuta may use Pulverise instead of an auto, dealing moderate  damage. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 You can use  or run 2 tiles away to avoid this. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 You only have 1 tick to move far enough when the text 'I'll pulverise you!' appears. \u200b Waters \u2b25 Once his HP reaches 275k, Masuta will stop attacking, start levitating, reducing all damage to 1. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Thrashing waters will start spawning randomly periodically. They have 8000 HP and a very long-ranged  autoattack. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Up to 15 Thrashing Waters will be spawned over 90s. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Pray Deflect Magic  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 When a water is killed, players within a 2 tiles receive a 5% Calm Waters buff. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 This reduces the damage from Tsunamis in next phase relative to the percentage of the buff. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Use  to sustain HP during this phase and  whenever it comes up to reduce damage taken. \u200b Last phase \u2b25 Masuta yells 'These waters will choke you where you stand!' and returns to the floor from his levitation. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 After he resumes attacking, he always does 2  autos followed by a Tsunami. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 For the rest of the phase, Masuta will cycle between using 3-6  autos and then a powerful  Tsunami attack. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Standing far away can help with prayer flicking as both autos and Tsunami will hit later. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 The magic attack has a travel time based on distance. While in MD the attack hits you instantly, while Ranged autoattacks take 1 tick to hit you. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 As Masuta has an attack speed of 4 ticks, by rotating your overhead prayers  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192 repeat, you will always be praying correctly. \u200b"},{"location":"pvme-guides/basic-guides/ed1-basic/#masuta-the-ascended-fight-tips","title":"Masuta, the Ascended (Fight tips)","text":"<p>\u2b25 You may want to bank or use a preset with more food for this encounter.</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>\u2b25 If you receive a second Hurricane special (where  is down), try to stay as far away from Masuta as possible.

Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Summoned blackholes will cover a 2x2 area, dealing rapid and increasing damage (~2000 per tick) to players standing on them, lasting for about 10 seconds before disappearing. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Move out (1 tile north/east or 2 tiles south/west) of it to avoid damage. \u200b Huge Breath \u2b25 The message 'Seiryu takes a huge breath!' appears and Seiryu will swing his head from east to west while doing a breath attack. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 This deals ~8000  attack unprotected. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 You can dodge this attack by standing along the 2 southern rows of the arena. Alternatively, use ,  or . \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 The hit lands when Seiryu's head reaches west making it easy to react to. \u200b Shadow Energy \u2b25 The game message 'Shadow energy bursts forth from Seiryu.' appears, and Seiryu launches a shadow projectile towards a tile marked by an arrow. Shortly after, highly damaging black hands will move from the marked tile towards your current location. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Move out of the way when the black hands spawn. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 The hands have moderate KO potential so be careful especially if the projectile lands near you. \u200b Black Hands \u2b25 Replaces Seiryu's 2nd Shadow Energy mechanic. Black hands spawn from a random point along the south wall and move north, expanding out in V-shape pattern. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 These hands are extremely damaging, avoiding them is vital. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Take extremely caution especially if using  and don't stand directly at the south wall when this mechanic is imminent. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Once this mechanic has been cast, a new set of black hands will spawn when the current formation is complete. \u200b Shackle \u2b25 At 7200k HP, Seiryu stops his attacks and lowers his head, all existing mechanics then disappear. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 You will be able to climb the shackle at these two points and start damaging the Black Crystals on the shackle. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 The crystals have 150K HP and can be damaged using . The fight ends once all of them are destroyed. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 After some time, 6 shadow enigmas will spawn and slowly move towards Seiryu. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 Upon reaching his face, enigmas will heal crystals by 50k HP each. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 Ignore the first set of enigmas and DPS the crystals. \u200b Post-Shackle \u2b25 After the 6th heal is finished, you have 13.2 seconds before you get stunned and teleported back down from the shackle. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 During this time, a second set of enigmas will have spawned. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 Tag and kill them before attacking Seiryu. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Seiryu heals back to 7500k HP. Get him down to below 7200k again to continue killing the black crystals. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 After dragging you down, Seiryu will always start with a Huge Breath attack before continuing his attacking rotation from the previous phase. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29  or  before getting dragged down, and walk to the south wall while tagging and killing the enigmas to avoid the breath. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 Continue attacking Seiryu afterwards. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 If you kill all 3 crystals during the first shackle segment, the fight ends and this portion will not happen. \u200b"},{"location":"pvme-guides/basic-guides/ed1-basic/#seiryu-the-azure-serpent-fight-tips","title":"Seiryu, the Azure Serpent (Fight tips)","text":"<p>\u2b25 Seiryu can be  permanently when standing along the 2 southern rows of the arena.</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Be careful of the V-shaped Shadow Hands if doing this.</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>\u2b25 HP can be sustained very easily if  flicking.</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If not, the easiest way to sustain your HP without needing much food is using  on the huge breath attack.</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>\u2b25 Move as little you need to avoid the shadow mechanics, to avoid negatively affecting your DPS.</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 1 tile east for blackholes.</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 2-3 tiles to avoid hands from shadow energy.</p> <p>\u2b25 For learners, you will likely start off with 3-cycling Seiryu, eventually being able to 2-cycle once comfortable with the fight.</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>\u2b25 Start of fight:</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Use your damage boosting ultimate   to start the fight.</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Use abilities until Seiryu phases.

The stun lasts for 3 seconds and the baby dinosaurs take 3 seconds to rush the player. Therefore, the best time to use the abilities above is when the stun expires.

Phase Meter and Golems \u2b25 Meter naturally decreases. \u2b25 Meter increases when Telos is standing in the beam. \u2b25 With 1 golem alive, the meter slowly decreases. \u2b25 With 2 golems alive, the meter remains stationary (increases and decreases back and fourth). \u2b25 With 3 golems alive, the meter increases. Shockwaves and Drain \u2b25 If meter is on the left side \u2192 Drain: Telos drains the player's adrenaline and prayer points. Example \u2b25 If meter is on the right side \u2192 Shockwaves: Rapid, hard hitting soft-typeless attacks.

Telos will not re-enter MD if you move away from him on P4 after his first attack. \u2b25 Phase 4 is split into 4 smaller sections, separated by 3 fonts. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Deal a quarter of Telos's starting phase HP to phase him into a font. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Once phased, you lose your target, Telos becomes untargetable, walks up to a font and spawns 3 different-coloured golems. Golems \u2b25 Three different-coloured melee golems spawn at each font. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Red golems attacks are able to stun after their first 3 hits. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 Utilise , resort to  if you got stunned. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Red golems have normal attack range. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Green and black golems have halberd attack range. Fonts \u2b25 To block Telos's instakill, players must walk up to and charge the fonts with their HP, for a total of 5 hits while dealing with golems. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 Utilise  +  to reduce damage taken from fonts. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 Relevant defensives do NOT work on the last hit of fonts. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 Once the instakill is negated, all of your defensive abilities get placed on a 6s cooldown. Font 3 \u2b25 Wrap around the center of the room and wait for the three golems to spawn. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 When the golems reach you, (tc) furthest golem \u2192  +  +  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 See example here \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Charge the font and phase Telos into P5. Weak Anima Bomb \u2b25 Telos fires a slow moving orb that deals soft-typeless damage. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 The player's overload timer is constantly drained after getting hit until cleansed. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 Ideally skip the mechanic, otherwise block using  /  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 Cleanse the overload debuff by stepping into one of the fonts. So Much Power (SMP) \u2b25 Once phase meter is filled, the next special attack is replaced by an SMP. Example \u2b25 Telos fires a deadly soft-typeless attack paired with a normal attack (much like Hold Still). \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 Ideally skip the mechanic, otherwise block with  or  Phase 5 Auto-Attacks Telos only attacks with magic throughout this phase. Note: Telos attacks 1 tick faster if green beam is not blocked by the player. Strategy \u2b25 Telos spawns 6 similar-colored minions at the start of the phase. \u2b25 Make your way to the green beam. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Lure golems properly. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 To do this, always start by going to the left beam. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 If side beams \u2192 enter the 2nd tile in the green beam. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 If back beam \u2192 enter the 4th tile in the beam. Rock \u2b25 A single rock falls at certain times during the phase. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 Utilise  +  Virus \u2b25 The player receives a random-coloured virus that deals constant damage. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 To cleanse the virus stand in the beam of the same colour. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 Utilise / + /  Phase Meter \u2b25 Gradually fills up \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Once filled, Telos begins charging an instakill attack and receives heavily reduced damage. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 Ideally kill before he can use this mechanic, otherwise  <p>\u200b</p>"},{"location":"pvme-guides/basic-guides/telos-basic/#stunning-guide","title":"Stunning Guide","text":"<p>Mage has access to 3 different stun abilities:</p> <p>\u2b25  Stuns for 1 GCD (3ticks/1.8s)</p> <p>\u2b25  Stuns for 1 GCD + 2 ticks (5ticks/3s)</p> <p>\u2b25  Stuns for the first 3 hits.

The debuff can spread even further if the affected enemies are killed quickly enough with other enemies nearby.</p> <p>\u2b25 If you have spare adrenaline which you wont need for ,  is usually the strongest single ability to use.

This is natural and necessary to improve at PvM.</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>\u2b25 Some examples include:</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Learning proper ECB.</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Incorporating 4taa</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Revo to full manual</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>Improvement will be slower as you progress upward. You will not always be able to improve as fast as you did initially.</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>\u2b25 You can mitigate this by either:</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Taking on learning something that is currently way beyond your skill level (only if you are not easily discouraged).</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Make drastic changes to your PvM style to copy what you see more experienced players use.</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>Asking for help</p> <p>Asking for help in PvM can be hard, but alas, sharing experiences with a more experienced player and getting feedback can make learning much smoother, here are a few things to take note of and remember.</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>Do not be scared! The first step is always the hardest. Remember, good PvMers are usually not as judgmental as you might think. Most of them have been where you are and can often offer very relevant advice on overcoming specific challenges or reaching specific benchmarks.</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>\u2b25 Be more open-minded/willing to try.</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Helpful solutions/strategies are often plans that are not immediately obvious or require proper trial and error.</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you receive an idea or suggestion that you feel does not apply or is too advanced, do not dismiss it immediately but keep it in mind as something to try later on.</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Proactive open-mindedness allows you to fully utilise suggestions and ideas that you would have shrugged off otherwise.</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>\u2b25 View feedback objectively.</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Take feedback given in vod reviews or trials as matter-of-fact statements and never as a personal attack on one's ability.</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2b29 Sometimes feedback you receive may seem nitpicky or blunt, this is often the result of reviewers stating their thoughts in honest details to drive across everything they think you need to know.</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Most players giving feedback are NEVER trying to attack you personally or purposely acting condescending to make you feel bad.

Why?</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Detonate is an Area-of-effect ability that doesn't work well with revolution - you will have to activate this manually as it requires charging. Revolution will override the charge and \"waste\" the ability.</p> <p>\u2b25 What are Special Attacks  and how do I use them?</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Certain weapons e.g.  have special attacks - these are powerful abilities that you have to activate manually. Therefore, place  outside your revolution bar (the abilities with gold trim around them) if your weapon has one. You can find the ability in your Constitution  abilities.</p> <p>\u2b25 How do I select a spell?</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 To select a  combat spell:</p> <p>Spellbook \u2192 right click chosen spell \u2192 select auto cast \u2192 select option 3 (main hand &amp; off-hand).</p> <p>\u2b25 When should I change spells?</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You should regularly upgrade your auto-cast to the highest available spell tier. You can find out a spell's damage level cap by checking its tooltip.</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 For example: Air strike's damage cap is at level 16 - you can upgrade to Air bolt at level 17.</p> <p>\u2b25 Can I just train slayer?</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You certainly can if you want some variety. It is, however, slower to train at lower combat levels.</p> <p>\u2b25 Why are weapons upgrades more important than armour upgrades? / Why is power armour recommended over tank armour?</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Frankly put: You gain more from hitting harder than from getting hit less. A higher tier weapon lets you hit harder by increasing hit chance and damage bonus. Power armour increases damage bonus too.

Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Corruption causes the player's damage dealt and taken to increase by the same percentage. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Caps at 50%, and resets down to 25% after every kill. \u200b 50k HP \u2b25 The Magister goes berserk: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Increases his damage output while losing some defence. \u200b Resonance \u2b25 Magister will heal for the damage you would have dealt. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 It is best to use a bleed or a weak ability to minimise his healing. \u200b Freedom \u2b25 Magister cannot freedom while stunned, he will only freedom when he is bound. Should you bind him before or during a bleed, he can clear it. Example \u200b Siphon \u2b25 When the player is at 70%+ adrenaline, the Magister can drain some of their adrenaline. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Aim to stay below 70% adrenaline during ultimates. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Be wary of adrenaline drain prior to ultimates.  Note: The three abilities mentioned above replace an auto attack and instead delay Magister's next auto attack by only 0.6s. \u200b  <p>\u200b</p>"},{"location":"pvme-guides/rs3-full-boss-guides/magister/#specials","title":"Specials","text":"Specials Power Blast \u2b25 The Magister slams his staff into the ground, sending out a red lightning attack. Example \u2b25 Deals ~2300 ranged damage (100% accurate) and can be dealt with by: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Deflect Missiles  / Disruption Shield  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Resonance  \u200b Barge \u2b25 Signaled by the voice line 'You dare fight me?'' \u2b25 After a 1.8s delay, the Magister will barge to 1 sq south of player. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Deals ~2300 melee damage in a 5x5 area and disables protection prayers for a small duration. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Walk one tile north to avoid this. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Alternatively use  /  , then move a tile away to avoid being md. \u200b Stand Still \u2b25 Only occurs if the player is md of Magister after his barge. \u2b25 The Magister will yell 'Stand still!'' and stun the player for 4.2s, dealing ~2300 melee damage before dashing away in a random direction. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Use Freedom  + Deflect Magic . \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Use a halberd range weapon if meleeing. Note: This mechanic replaces the Barge mechanic while the player is in melee distance. \u200b Dashing \u2b25 Occurs during his Stand Still special attack. \u2b25 Magister will dash up to 8 tiles away from the starting pillar if he is too close to it \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 This usually happens after his Barge special attack on a player stood close to the starting pillar. \u2b25 The Magister can chain these previous 3 actions together. \u200b Unstable Mixture \u2b25 A bomb is thrown in the general vicinity of the player. Example \u2b25 It explodes after the bar above it fills, dealing typeless damage in a 5x5 area to whatever is near it. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Deals 4000 damage to the player and the Magister and 2000 damage to the player's familiar. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Can be clicked to kick away. \u200b Asphyxiate \u2b25 The Magister will asphyxiate the player, dealing ~1500-3000 damage for 3 hits and healing off the base damage. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 This ability does not stun and can be dealt with by moving or by using a melee threshold. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 The Magister will continue auto attacking mid asphyxiate if stunned. \u200b Restore Me \u2b25 The Magister will regain several thousand lifepoints. Example \u2b25 More likely to use this after falling below 50k lifepoints and it is often the first special attack he will use at that point. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Can be avoided by stun-locking him, dealing damage and killing him before he can spec. \u200b Minions \u2b25 Only happens once the Magister has performed a sufficient number of special attacks beforehand. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Two Soul Devourer minions spawn using random combat styles. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 They have 10,000 HP and remain until either they die or the fight ends. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 It is recommended to kill them unless the fight is at least halfway over. \u200b  <p>\u200b</p>"},{"location":"pvme-guides/rs3-full-boss-guides/magister/#presets-and-relics","title":"Presets and Relics","text":"Preset Suggestions \u2b25 Melee (Basic)  \u2b25 Melee (Advanced) <p>\u200b</p>"},{"location":"pvme-guides/rs3-full-boss-guides/magister/#melee-strategy","title":"Melee Strategy","text":"<p>\u2b25 Avoid using high damaging abilities like Tuska's Wrath , Wild Magic , Snap Shot  etc. while the boss is slightly above 150k, 100k, and 50k hp as he will absorb any extra damage dealt to reach those exact numbers.</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Damage is counted towards progressing phases before truncation.</p> <p>\u2b25 Magister's phasing is based on him attempting to auto attack or taking a hit of damage within attack range (which is instead mitigated), as such, if you are outside of his attack range, he will not phase.</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This only really applies to ranged weapons at 9 tiles when he is bound.</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This also implies that he will sometimes phase a few ticks after reaching his HP threshold instead of instantly, meaning you should be wary about using strong abilities around his HP thresholds, lest they get mitigated.</p> <p>\u2b25 For corruption stacks, the speed of the last 50k doesn't matter as much on the first kill, do not burst through it.

Where successful, this rotation should save one minute on the Masuta kill.</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>Explanation:</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>\u2b25 Masuta phases to the timelocked Thrashing Waters special at 275k hp, and can no longer phase after 55k hp. The goal of this rotation is therefore to kill Masuta on the 'Persistent Hurricane' spin attack (the long special attack) so it cannot phase into the Thrashing Waters phase.</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>\u2b25 Masuta's attack pattern has a random number of auto attacks between specials, but the number of auto attacks follows a normal distribution, meaning you will generally encounter the following pattern:</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>\u2b25 2-4 auto-attacks</p> <p>\u2b25 Persistent Hurricane</p> <p>\u2b25 3-5 auto-attacks</p> <p>\u2b25 Greater Shadow Tsunami</p> <p>\u2b25 3-5 auto-attacks</p> <p>\u2b25 Repeats from Hurricane</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>\u2b25 in preparation for his second Hurricane special, you will want to ensure you have full  and  stacks before his second hurricane, and leave a 10-15k hp buffer (285k-300k Masuta hp) and cease before the Persistent Hurricane due to conjure, reflect, cracking and aftershock damage.</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>\u2b25 Utilising   is useful for skip consistency.

This item resurrects the player after death and gives the player 15% of their base life points.

Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Targeted to a tile rather than the player and has travel time before it hits \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 It is possible to dodge every Ranged autoattack simply by moving before the attack lands (not necessary). \u200b Water Burst \u2b25 Sanctum ducks down and rises back up quickly, splashing water and dealing heavy  damage. Example \u2b25 Use  as soon as you see this mechanic as it is very fast. You can also  this if needed. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Staying or moving out of range in time will cause the attack to miss. Doing this is usually unnecessary. Example \u200b Water Jet \u2b25 Sanctum spews water, rotating from North anti-clockwise, dealing ~6000 soft typeless damage if the player is caught in it. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 This mechanic can be avoided by moving to dodge it or via  or . \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 You can also  or  to reduce the damage if need be, although these are less efficient. \u200b Purple Smoke \u2b25 A blue bar appears above your character. When it drains, a cloud of smoke will cover a 5x5 area centered around your location. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 The smoke deals rapid typeless damage every tick which increases very fast, hitting ~4000 a tick eventually.

Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 It is important to block these doubled autos with  \u200b Hurricane \u2b25 Masuta starts spinning for about 12 seconds, hitting nearby players for increasing Melee damage once per tick, chasing after you at walking speed during this attack. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 The best way to deal with this is  +  1 GCD after the attack starts, allowing you to deal damage in MD and nullifies most of the damage you take. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 If using ranged, you may kite Masuta and use  once he finishes spinning. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 It's possible to  Masuta from the north side during this attack. \u200b Tsunami \u2b25 After Hurricane, Masuta returns to autoing, usually around the 4th, 5th or 6th autoattack, purple waters appear around the arena. The purples water thrash about while Masuta uses 3 more autos. Right after the 3rd auto, Masuta uses a Tsunami on his target. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 These hit you with two extremely high (7k+)  hits. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 This can be dealt with by using both  and  after Masuta's 3rd autoattack. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 You can also move far enough to avoid getting hit. This can be done by either running or using  as the auto before the  hits. Example \u200b Pulverise \u2b25 After Tsunami, for the rest of Phase 1 Masuta may use Pulverise instead of an auto, dealing moderate  damage. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 You can use  or run 2 tiles away to avoid this. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 You only have 1 tick to move far enough when the text 'I'll pulverise you!' appears. \u200b Waters \u2b25 Once his HP reaches 275k, Masuta will stop attacking, start levitating, reducing all damage to 1. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Thrashing waters will start spawning randomly periodically. They have 8000 HP and a very long-ranged  autoattack. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Up to 15 Thrashing Waters will be spawned over 90s. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Pray Deflect Magic  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 When a water is killed, players within a 2 tiles\u00a0receive a 5% Calm Waters buff. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 This reduces the damage from Tsunamis in next phase relative to the percentage of the buff. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Use  to sustain HP during this phase and  whenever it comes up to reduce damage taken. \u200b Last phase \u2b25 Masuta yells 'These waters will choke you where you stand!' and returns to the floor from his levitation. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 After he resumes attacking, he always does 2  autos followed by a Tsunami. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 For the rest of the phase, Masuta will cycle between using 3-6  autos and then a powerful  Tsunami attack. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Standing far away can help with prayer flicking as both autos and Tsunami will hit later. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 The magic attack has a travel time based on distance. While in MD the attack hits you instantly, while Ranged autoattacks take 1 tick to hit you. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 As Masuta has an attack speed of 4 ticks, by rotating your overhead prayers  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192 repeat, you will always be praying correctly. \u200b"},{"location":"pvme-guides/rs3-full-boss-guides/ed1-temple-of-aminishi/ranged/#strategy_1","title":"Strategy","text":"<p>\u2b25 Start</p> <p>Notes: This rotation requires the  Heightened senses relic.</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>Crossbows </p> <p>(tc)   \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192   \u2192   \u2192 auto   \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  (walk under) \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192   \u2192 dump until Masuta phases.</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>Bows </p> <p>(tc)   \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192   \u2192   \u2192 auto   \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  (walk under) \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192   \u2192 dump until Masuta phases.</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>\u2b25 Start Notes</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 At the start camp  and swap to  for 2 abilities after Ruby proc.

This fight will challenge a player's ability to utilise the space they have in the arena to avoid a series of area-based mechanics.</p> <p>\u200b</p> Mechanics Face (7500k-7200k HP) \u2b25 Seiryu first does 4 attacks then continues with the following attack rotation \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Huge Breath \u2192 2 attacks \u2192 Shadow Energy \u2192 2 attacks \u2192 repeat \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Seiryu's standard attack is either a slow  attack (easy to flick) or a tail blackhole. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 The 2nd Shadow Energy mechanic will be replaced by the Black Hands mechanic. \u200b Tail Blackhole \u2b25 Seiryu dips his tail into the floor to summon a black hole under the player. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Summoned blackholes will cover a 2x2 area, dealing rapid and increasing damage (~2000 per tick) to players standing on them, lasting for about 10 seconds before disappearing. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Move out (1 tile north/east or 2 tiles south/west) of it to avoid damage. \u200b Huge Breath \u2b25 The message 'Seiryu takes a huge breath!' appears and Seiryu will swing his head from east to west while doing a breath attack. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 This deals ~8000  attack unprotected. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 You can dodge this attack by standing along the 2 southern rows of the arena. Alternatively, use ,  or . \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 The hit lands when Seiryu's head reaches west making it easy to react to. \u200b Shadow Energy \u2b25 The game message 'Shadow energy bursts forth from Seiryu.' appears, and Seiryu launches a shadow projectile towards a tile marked by an arrow. Shortly after, highly damaging black hands will move from the marked tile towards your current location. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Move out of the way when the black hands spawn. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 The hands have moderate KO potential so be careful especially if the projectile lands near you. \u200b Black Hands \u2b25 Replaces Seiryu's 2nd Shadow Energy mechanic. Black hands spawn from a random point along the south wall and move north, expanding out in V-shape pattern. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 These hands are extremely damaging, avoiding them is vital. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Take extremely caution especially if using  and don't stand directly at the south wall when this mechanic is imminent. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 Once this mechanic has been cast, a new set of black hands will spawn when the current formation is complete. \u200b Shackle \u2b25 At 7200k HP, Seiryu stops his attacks and lowers his head, all existing mechanics then disappear. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 You will be able to climb the shackle at these two points and start damaging the Black Crystals on the shackle. Example \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 The crystals have 150K HP and can be damaged using . The fight ends once all of them are destroyed. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 After some time, 6 shadow enigmas will spawn and slowly move towards Seiryu.

Get him down to below 7200k again to continue killing the black crystals. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 After dragging you down, Seiryu will always start with a Huge Breath attack before continuing his attacking rotation from the previous phase. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29  or  before getting dragged down, and walk to the south wall while tagging and killing the enigmas to avoid the breath. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2b29 Continue attacking Seiryu afterwards. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2022 If you kill all 3 crystals during the first shackle segment, the fight ends and this portion will not happen. \u200b"},{"location":"pvme-guides/rs3-full-boss-guides/ed1-temple-of-aminishi/ranged/#strategy_2","title":"Strategy","text":"<p>Note: Camp Hydrix bolts </p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>Crossbows </p> <p>(tc)   \u2192  \u2192   \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192   \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192   \u2192  \u2192 improvise until phased \u2192  onto 1 of the yellow climb spots</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>Bows </p> <p>(tc)  +   \u2192  \u2192   \u2192   \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192   \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192   \u2192  \u2192 improvise until phased \u2192  onto 1 of the yellow climb spots</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p></p> <p>Phase 1 Notes</p> <p>\u2b25 If using , place it further away from head (East / West) so you can dodge Seiryu's tendril attack without leaving Flank  range.</p> <p>\u2b25 Lower HP to ~5k before Shadow Tendrils, only heal up to ~3k before each mage hit after Shadow Tendrils , camp mage prayer after   to lower your HP even more (~1.5k).</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This is so that you can benefit from the Berserker's Fury  relic power.</p> <p>\u2b25 Make sure to end on 90%+ adren so that you don't have to rely on  procs.</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>Crossbows </p>"},{"location":"pvme-guides/rs3-full-boss-guides/ed1-temple-of-aminishi/ranged/#crystal-1","title":"Crystal 1","text":"<p>Note: (Camp , swap to  if you get a ruby proc)</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>Spam Target Cycle and   \u2192  \u2192   \u2192  \u2192  \u2192   \u2192  \u2192   \u2192  \u2192 auto  \u2192 improvise if not dead.</p> <p>\u200b</p>"},{"location":"pvme-guides/rs3-full-boss-guides/ed1-temple-of-aminishi/ranged/#crystal-2","title":"Crystal 2","text":"<p>Note: Camp Hydrix bolts , use  for thresholds if needed</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>  \u2192   \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192 improvise</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>Note: Improvise using  \u2192  if you don't get  procs.

To improve from here, spend less time dealing with Roots and other mechanics on P1, and aim to make good use of the flank shield for the first Rain attack. Aim to reach the P2 HP cap by the 2nd Rain attack in order to avoid having to use Barricade to deal with the Hurricane. Transition from charging all pads p3 to dealing with erethdor, as this saves easily 2 minutes if the phase can be done in 4 pads. At this point, becoming more comfortable with mechanics is the main focus.</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>\u2b25 10-8 mins - Here you will be working on refining your kills from the 10 min range, getting consistency in your 1 cycle cores, and implementing advanced skips like Bomb skips in P1. After this, phasing Solak in P2 consistently with the first hit of the second rain attack, killing Erethdor in 2 cycles and making efficient use of pads. Starting P3 without cleansing is expected by this point. With the use of Berserk  or Death's Swiftness  and strong damage, No Realm kills are expected to be implemented here, saving 10-15+ seconds.</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>\u2b25 8-6 mins - Here you will be working on consistent 1 cycle cores with advanced skips, Bomb or Root skips.

Using escape  prior to detonate will allow you to force mage autos, while keeping you within familiar range and maximum weapon range.</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>(DW)   \u2192   (3 hit) \u2192  \u2192   \u2192   \u2192   \u2192  \u2192   \u2192  (3t) \u2192   (forces mage autos for the rest of the phase) \u2192 </p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>\u2b25 Depending on HP, you can:</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u25cf Fastest (~310k hp):   \u2192 excal stall  (or  if not stalling)</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u25cf Fast:  (2H)  (2-hit) \u2192  \u2192  \u2192 excal stall  (or  if not stalling)</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u25cf Slow:  (2H)  (2-hit) \u2192  \u2192 (DW)  \u2192 (DW for accuracy)  \u2192  \u2192  \u2192 .</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>Note: If the phase hp is reached after , replace  \u2192  with (DW)  wait 2 ticks \u2192 (2H)  (stall) .

The first one is added to the damage counter, it checks if 10,000 &gt;= 20,000 and finds that is false, so that hit doesn\u2019t cause it to push.</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The next hit is then added to the damage counter, which is now at 20,000 damage. It checks if 20,000 &gt;= 20,000 and finds that is true, so the boss pushes and resets the damage counter to 0.</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Finally, the last hit of 10,000 is added to the damage counter, and it performs the same check, but finds that 10,000 &gt;= 20,000 does not hold true. This 10,000 damage stays in the damage counter until the next tick, and this damage is referred to as \u201coverflow\u201d. So the result of these hits is pushing one tile with 10,000 overflow.</p> <p>\u200b</p> <p>\u2b25 Example C:</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Suppose there is one last hit of 10,000 damage on that tick. Again, this 10,000 is added to the damage counter as before, for a total of 20,000 damage.</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The game performs the same check and finds that 20,000 is in fact at least 20,000, so the damage counter resets.</p> <p>\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Vorago cannot be pushed twice on the same tick, so hitting this 40,000 damage mark in one tick may actively be detrimental to a kill, as you will end up losing 20,000 damage.</p> <p>\u200b</p>"},{"location":"pvme-guides/rs3-full-boss-guides/vorago/tips-and-tricks/#skipping-debilitate-on-p5","title":"Skipping Debilitate on P5","text":"<p>Debilitate should be skipped after bleeds because while it does have a chance of blocking push back, it can negatively impact stall.
