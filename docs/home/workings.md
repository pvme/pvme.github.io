# How The Site Works

The build process can be summarized as followed:

1. Gather the guides from the [pvme-guides repository](https://github.com/pvme/pvme-guides).
2. Build the website using [MKDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material).

Check out [Github](https://github.com/pvme/pvme.github.io) for more info on the build process.

## Limitations

First and foremost, the guides on the website are always up-to-date with the Discord Server.

This is because both are using the `.txt` guides from the [pvme-guides repository](https://github.com/pvme/pvme-guides).

With that being said, the `.txt` guides are primarily aimed at Discord. The result is that some content might not appear correctly on the website:

- References to social Discord exclusive channels (`#pvm-help`)
- Mentions of `$linkmsg` 

I try to stay ahead of this by adding formatting rules that exclude certain content or change it to make it work properly.

If you find any formatting issues or bugs, please message me on Discord (Pleb#0025) or create an issue on [Github](https://github.com/pvme/pvme.github.io).
