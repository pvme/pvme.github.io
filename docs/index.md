# About

Welcome to the PvM Encyclopedia (PvME) website!

PvME is a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/6djqFVN) with the largest collection of RS3 (and some OSRS) PvM guides.

<script src="javascripts/discordInvite.js"></script>
<script>
discordInvite.init({
  inviteCode: '6djqFVN',
  title: 'PVME',
  });
  discordInvite.render();
</script>
<div id="discordInviteBox"></div>

This site has all the same guides as the Discord server and is updated daily.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this site is to make the PvME guides accessible to anyone who doesn't use Discord.

A custom-built website also makes it easier to navigate guides by having: 

- Always visible table of contents.
- A powerful search.
